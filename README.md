# Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my **Basic EDA** repository! This collection showcases the EDA practices and projects I've been working on as part of my journey to becoming a skilled data scientist.

## Purpose
Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical step in any data science project. It helps in:
- Understanding the underlying patterns in the data.
- Identifying relationships between variables.
- Detecting anomalies and outliers.
- Gaining insights to guide future analysis or modeling.

## Tools and Libraries
The following libraries were used extensively for the analysis:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **Plotly** (if used): For interactive plots.

## Skills Demonstrated
Through these projects, I have worked on:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Univariate and multivariate analysis.
- Visualizing data patterns and trends.
- Identifying correlations and insights for further exploration.

## Future Work
I plan to:
- Expand the scope of EDA with more complex datasets.
- Explore more advanced EDA techniques, including feature engineering and hypothesis testing.
- Implement EDA as part of end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
